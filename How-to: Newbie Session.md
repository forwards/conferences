# How to organise the useR! Forwards Newbie Session

This pre-conference session is aimed at newcomers to useR! as an introduction to the conference and the wider R community. The session will feature short talks, open discussion and informal networking. 

For Organisers:
* First step is to coordinate with the conference organisation team
	* Request a room for 2 hours to run the Forwards Newbie session a day before the main event.  Preferably after the tutorials, foundation meeting, and developer days events end, so participants can join. If they have a cocktail hour for one of those events our social time should overlap so newbies can interact with the participants of the other two events
	* Have them advertise the session on the main conference page, in the program or under “side events”.  For example:
> 	[Forwards](forwards.github.io) is organizing a session for newcomers to useR! As an introduction to the conference and the wider R community on DATE AND TIME at LOCATION. There will be a social time TIME(first hour), followed by an hour of short talks:
> 	
> 	Forwards (SPEAKER)
> 	The R ecosystem (SPEAKER)
> 	R User Groups (SPEAKER)
> 	Contributing to the ecosystem (SPEAKER)
> 	R ladies (SPEAKER)
>     Making the most of useR! (SPEAKER)
>     useR! abstract review: what the program committee look for (SPEAKER)
>     rOpenSci onboarding system and community (SPEAKER)
>     Collaborative coding (SPEAKER)
>     Making a career from coding (SPEAKER)
	* Get information about the tech requirements so you can ask speakers to send you slides in advance if needed. Plan to be at the room earlier and ask the speakers to do the same so you can test the setup.
* Invite speakers:
	* You can repeat topics from previous years. Try to find people that can talk  for 10 minutes about the conference, how to participate in R communities, how to contribute to R through open source, taking into account technical skills and navigating the ecosystem. It’s a great opportunity for prominent people in the R community to interact with newbies and a lot of them are happy to take part and make useR! More inclusive. 
	* Example invitation:
> 	Hope you are doing well, 
> 	I was wondering if you would be willing to give a small talk for the newbies sessions. We’re looking for speakers that can help introduce the conference and the community for first time attendees. 
> 	Some topics from previous years were: The R ecosystem, Making the most of useR!, rOpenSci onboarding system and community, and Making the most of useR!
> 	
> 	I think you are quite active with PROJECT so you could speak about TOPIC or about TOPIC? what do you think? or another topic? 
> 	If in addition, you think about other persons or  topics that could be relevant, to give a small talk (it is 10 minutes max on DAY evening), please let me know. 

* Marketing:
	* Tweet about it from the forwards account with a link to the main conference schedule / side events. You can also link to the Forwards GitHub page, simply make a markdown file with all the details for useR! Forwards events.
