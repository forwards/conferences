# [WiP] How to organise a useR! Code of conduct response team

## Purpose and scope of the team


## Before the event: 
define the team, set up the email, set up how to identify and introduce the team, prepare the team, orga team vs. volunteer team with orga point of contact

## Resources to prepare team members
- [R Foundation CoC Policy](https://www.r-project.org/coc-policy.html)
- [Forwards Guidelines](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md) for Code of Conduct Policy. This is a draft that has not yet been accepted by the R Foundation.
- This [CoC Response ebook](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/) contains many useful case studies. Previous team members found it useful to read it before the event.
- Forwards can share annonimized previous reports with the team, but they are nto for public circulation.


## During the event
Team members should check the coc email regulary. 
You might want to take turns being responsible for it so you don't feel like you're spending the rntie conference worried about checking for new emails.

If an incident is reported one team member should take the lead on [receiving the report](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#receiving-code-of-conduct-violation-reports), 
[rorming the response](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#response-to-harrassment-report), 
and [communicating the response](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#communicating-the-response). 

We recommend that another team memeber accompanies the lead responder as a quiet observer, when they recieve the report, and communicate the response.
They can then help the responder remember details, give advice, and provide emotional support. 

We also recommend that the entire team, has a chance to get clarifications, and provide feedback on the proposed response. 
We also recommend that a core organiser and core Forwards member join them. 
For this purpose, we recommend that the organisers inform the team if there is a quiet room thet can use on demand.

## After the event
Finalise all the annonimised reports.

Forwards is collecting annonimised reports from across events to help prepare future response team. If you are happy to share your annonimised reports with us please send them to ADD EMAIL.
