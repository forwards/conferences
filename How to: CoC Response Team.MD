# [WiP] How to organise a useR! Code of conduct response team

## Purpose and scope of the team
Enforcing a code of conduct is difficult, expert, emotionally intense work. The code of conduct response team is responsible for taking reports, investigating, deciding on responses, implementing those responses, and informing the community about their decisions if needed. The team is what turns our code of conduct from a written document into meaningful action. To achieve this, they must have the full support of conference organisation comittee, and the R Foundation leadership, and have confidence they will not be overruled by them unless they have made a significant mistake.


## Before the event: 
### Gather a team of responders
Since participation in code of conduct response teams is usually volunteer work, the team should be large enough so that it can operate effectively even if a third of its members aren't available. It also need to be large in order to allow members to recuse tehmselves in they are a party to a report, or know one of hte parties. Previously the response team had 3-6 members.

We recomend that the response team is not comprised only from organisation comittee members, in case one of them is involved in a report. 

While it is not likely to gather a team that represents every axis of opression, it is advisable to have members that are aware that more than one opression exist. 
Members should be aware of the concept of [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), and not have a bias towards one form of opression being more severe than others.
In particular members should not have doubts about the effectiveness of the code of conduct, reservations about enforcing it, or more empathy for the people causing offence, than the people experience it.

## Resources to prepare team members
- [R Foundation CoC Policy](https://www.r-project.org/coc-policy.html)
- [Forwards Guidelines](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md) for Code of Conduct Policy. This is a draft that has not yet been accepted by the R Foundation.
- This [CoC Response ebook](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/) contains many useful case studies. Previous response team members found it useful to read it before the event.
- Forwards can share annonimised previous reports with the team, but they are not for public circulation.

## During the event
Team members should check the coc email regularly. 
You might want to take turns being responsible for it so you don't feel like you're spending the entire conference worried about checking for new emails.

If an incident is reported one team member should take the lead on [receiving the report](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#receiving-code-of-conduct-violation-reports), 
[rorming the response](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#response-to-harrassment-report), 
and [communicating the response](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#communicating-the-response). 

We recommend that another team member accompanies the lead responder as a quiet observer, when they receive the report, and communicate the response.
They can then help the responder remember details, give advice, and provide emotional support. 

We also recommend that the entire team, has a chance to get clarifications, and provide feedback on the proposed response. 
We also recommend that a core organiser and core Forwards member join them. 
For this purpose, we recommend that the organisers inform the team if there is a quiet room that can use on demand.

## After the event
Finalise all the annonimised reports.

Forwards is collecting annonimised reports from across events to help prepare future response team. If you are happy to share your annonimised reports with us please send them to ADD EMAIL.

Delete the event's CoC email and all other data as recommended by the [data retention policy](https://github.com/forwards/foundation/blob/7fe098d0fd82902c91449160487c90f768e4f39c/coc_policy/guidelines.md#data-retention-policy).
