- DEI nudges for orga teams
  - Program considerations invited keynote speakers, session chairs, invited/selected tutotial, channels and language to promote CfP

How-tos
- How-to template: how many people does it take, what does orga team need to provide, how early do you need ot start, previous process, example of previous resources

  - [How to organise useR! Diversity scholaships](https://github.com/forwards/conferences/blob/master/How-to:%20Diversity%20Scholarships.md)

Ideas for future:
- Add "Other ideas to consider"
  - [The newbie useR! 2018 tutorial](https://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2018/rcurious/index.html) as an additonal event. It doesn't replace the newbie session because our newbie session is for people new to the conference/R community not necessarily new to R. 
- Add "Earlier initiatives that are now incorporated into useR!"
  - Code of Conduct
  - Better gender balance in committees, chairs, keynotes, tutors (organisers should aim to include under-represented groups in all of these, not only women)
  - Diversity scholarships
  - R-Ladies does abstract review, encouraging women to do more talks. This can be extended to other under-represented groups.
  - childcare
  - Parent's room
