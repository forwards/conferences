# Tips for Diversity Scholarships

## Tips for Organizers

 - Make all fields mandatory to ensure all relevant information is provided.

## Tips for Applicants

 - Check whether the funder has a policy on awarding scholarships to people that attended under a scholarship previously, or who have had another scholarship in the past year. 
 
     - If there is a clear exclusion and this applies to you, please sit this one out, and allow someone else to have an opportunity for assistance.
     - Otherwise, disclose any scholarships as requested, but don't let previous success hold you back from applying.

 - Be as specific as possible - don't make the reviewers guess or infer things.
     
     For example, someone might put that their organization is XYZ Computing. But then they might not say what their job title is. 
 Are they an intern? Are they a full-time employee?

 - Break down costs as much as possible. 
 
     - When looking for airfare, look for the cost for coach. 
     - Don't leave any costs out. Let the committee decide if the cost is reasonable and can be covered by the scholarship.
 
 - Give evidence of your commitment to the field/community.
 
     Demonstrate that this is a real interest and that you are in it for the long term.
 
 - Explain how you will pay it forwards
 
     How will you share what you have learned? Let the committee know how their investment in you will have a wider impact.
