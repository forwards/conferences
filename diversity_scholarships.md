# Tips for Diversity Scholarships

## Tips for Organizers

 - Make all fields mandatory to ensure all relevant information is provided.

## Tips for Applicants

 - Check whether the funder has a policy on awarding scholarships to people that attended under a scholarship previously, or who have had another scholarship in the past year. 
 
     - If there is a clear exclusion and this applies to you, please sit this one out, and allow someone else to have an opportunity for assistance.
     - Otherwise, disclose any scholarships as requested, but don't let previous success hold you back from applying.

 - Be as specific as possible - don't make the reviewers guess or infer things.
     
     For example, someone might put that their organization is XYZ Computing. But then they might not say what their job title is. 
 Are they an intern? Are they a full-time employee?

 - Break down costs as much as possible. 
 
     - When looking for airfare, look for the cost for coach. 
     - Don't leave any costs out. Let the committee decide if the cost is reasonable and can be covered by the scholarship.
 
 - Give evidence of your commitment to the field/community.
 
     Demonstrate that this is a real interest and that you are in it for the long term, for example, for an R conference you might mention
      - R courses you have taken.
      - How you use R in your work.
      - Articles/blog posts where you have used R.
      - Contributions you have made to publicly available packages.
      - Involvement in R-ladies, an R User Group or other R-related initiative.
 
 - Explain how you will pay it forwards
 
     How will you share what you have learned? Let the committee know how their investment in you will have a wider impact. For example, for an R conference you might
     - Commit to writing a blog post. Evidence of previously blogging about R would be an advantage.
     - Commit to live tweeting to share conference highlights with the R community. Evidence of doing this for previous conferences, or using your Twitter account to share insights about R would be an advantage.
     - Commit to presenting a talk or workshop at your workplace/R user group. Prior experience of giving such presentations would be an advantage.
     - Discuss how you hope to integrate new R developments into your courses.
     - Describe your existing mentoring roles and discuss how up-to-date knowledge of R would be beneficial in these roles.
     - Discuss how a specific conference tutorial will facilitate work in progress that will be shared with the community.
     
- Make your application stand out by adding in some flavour about your personal journey in R 

    How did you get to this point? What is your motivation for applying? Without making your application too lengthy, paint the reader a picture of who you are, and why you deserve funding.
