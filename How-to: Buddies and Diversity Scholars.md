# How to organise the useR! Buddies and Diversity Scholars Meet and Greet

Forwards would like to introduce the diversity scholars, conference newbies, and other participants, with "conference buddies" to help them make the most of useR! (be someone to talk to, introduce them to others, etc). If you're a seasoned R community member, conference goer, or have previously attended useR!, and would like to be a conference buddy, please let us know here

We ask the useR! buddies to:
* Attend Diversity Scholarship Meet&Great on Monday Evening 
* Wear buddies lanyard/pins
* be friendly and helpful
* Use gender neutral language
* Help people connect and network so don’t feel like outsiders
* Have useful info about events and locations to offer 
* Have contacts of CoC, organisers, locals to get further help

For organisers:
* First step is to coordinate with the conference organisation team
	* How will buddies be marked? Badge colours, lanyard, arm band, etc.
	* How will buddies get their marker? At registration or do you need to distribute it?	
	* Will the buddies be announced during the welcome talk? e.g.g asked to stand up, or just mention how to find them to all conference goers.
	* We need rooms for the diversity scholars meet and greets. Preferably one on the workshop day, and one on day 1 of the main conference. 
	* They should provide you with the diversity scholars emails, or email them on your behalf, so you can introduce the buddies initiative, invite them to the meet and greet and newbie session, and ask them permission to share their names with other scholars and with the buddies.  
* A few weeks before the conference share a call for buddies by contacting:
	* Prominent R Community members
	* Diversity Scholars Committee 
	* R-Ladies slack channel for useR! attendees
	* RainbowR slack channel for useR! attendees
	* Forwards Members
	* Local R Community members 
	* Open call for buddies through Forwards twitter handle
* Example for call for buddies tweet:

> 
> <Link to schedule>
> 
> The first is an opportunity just for diversity scholars to meet members of Forwards and a few other people who have volunteered to be conference buddies - people you can come to during the conference to ask questions or just chat with during the breaks, in case you don’t know anyone already!
> 
> The second is open to anyone who is new to useR! and will have a program of short, informal talks on a variety of topics that we think will be helpful for newcomers to the R community. Hopefully this will be a gentle introduction to the conference, a chance to meet more people - perhaps people going to the same tutorials as you the next day!

> If you can’t come to these events, don’t worry. The team of conference buddies will be on the lookout for you to help you feel welcome at the conference. The conference buddies are:

> We don’t advertise the names of diversity scholars to all attendees as you may not wish to publicize your scholarship. However recipients from last year said they wish they had known who the other scholars were, so we would like to share your name with other diversity scholars as well as the team of conference buddies. Please answer this quick poll: <LINK TO FORM FOR SCHOLARS> to let us know if you are happy for us to share you name with either/both groups. If you wish to remain anonymous you should not attend the meet and greet! Of course your name is known to a few people on the evaluation committee and on the local organisation committee, but we will respect your wishes regarding confidentiality.

* There is a Google Form template you can copy for the scholars to agree to share their names [useR! Conference Buddies - Scholars Form](https://forms.gle/b8oX6RrX1ThHhiRh7). Please update the following:
	* 	Update logo image for current useR! combined with the Forwards logo
	* Update the year / hub in the form name
	* In the first question in section 2, replace “DATE AND TIME” with the relevant conference buddies meetings for your event
* About a week before the conference, or on a rolling basis as sign ups arrive, send the buddies a short email thanking them for volunteering, explaining what we ask them to do (see above), and give them the contact details for the forwards volunteer organising them so they have a go-to person. If you already know, tell them where they can get their buddy marker, or that you will be in touch with them on site. Be sure to put all email addresses in BCC to avoid sharing email addresses. 
* Example e-mail for buddies:
> Dear All,
> 
> Thanks for volunteering to be conference buddies at useR! For those of you that can make it, we will have a short meet and greet with the diversity scholars on DATE AND TIME. We will meet at LOCATION.
> 
> Note this is intended to be a private meeting and some diversity scholars wish their scholarship to be confidential, so please do not bring along anyone else without letting us know they are coming. We shall have to be discreet in moving to the main room for the newbie session!
> 
> Of course some of the diversity scholars will not be at the meet and greet, however I have shared your names with them so they know to look out for you. The following are happy for their name to be shared with you, so please look out for them:
> 
> The list of conference buddies is as follows:
> 
> Conference buddies will have a differently designed conference badge (red and black rather than the standard yellow and white), so that diversity scholars and other newbies will know that you’re happy to talk to them. If you haven’t already done so, please add a photo and profile to the conference portal/app, so that people can find out a bit more about you before coming.
