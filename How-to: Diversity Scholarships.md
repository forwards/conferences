For organisers:
* First step is to coordinate with the conference organisation team	    
	* We need rooms for the diversity scholars meet and greets. Preferably one on the workshop day, and one on day 1 of the main conference. 
	* They should provide you with the diversity scholars emails, or email them on your behalf, so you can introduce the buddies initiative, invite them to the meet and greet and newbie session, and ask them permission to share their names with other scholars and with the buddies.  
* Example for the email to the scholars (including the newbie session details):
> 	Dear Diversity Scholars,
> 
> We are looking forward to meeting you at useR! YEAR. We wanted to make sure you noticed the following events in the schedule on DATE:
> 
> <Link to schedule>
> 
> The first is an opportunity just for diversity scholars to meet members of Forwards and a few other people who have volunteered to be conference buddies - people you can come to during the conference to ask questions or just chat with during the breaks, in case you don’t know anyone already!
> 
> The second is open to anyone who is new to useR! and will have a program of short, informal talks on a variety of topics that we think will be helpful for newcomers to the R community. Hopefully this will be a gentle introduction to the conference, a chance to meet more people - perhaps people going to the same tutorials as you the next day!
> 
> If you can’t come to these events, don’t worry. The team of conference buddies will be on the lookout for you to help you feel welcome at the conference. The conference buddies are:
> LIST OF BUDDIES 
> 
> We don’t advertise the names of diversity scholars to all attendees as you may not wish to publicize your scholarship. However recipients from last year said they wish they had known who the other scholars were, so we would like to share your name with other diversity scholars as well as the team of conference buddies. Please answer this quick poll: <LINK TO FORM FOR SCHOLARS> to let us know if you are happy for us to share you name with either/both groups. If you wish to remain anonymous you should not attend the meet and greet! Of course your name is known to a few people on the evaluation committee and on the local organisation committee, but we will respect your wishes regarding confidentiality.
> 
> Best wishes,
> Name, on behalf of Forwards
* There is a Google Form template you can copy for the scholars to agree to share their names [useR! Conference Buddies - Scholars Form](https://forms.gle/b8oX6RrX1ThHhiRh7). Please update the following:
	* 	Update logo image for current useR! combined with the Forwards logo
	* Update the year / hub in the form name
	* In the first question in section 2, replace “DATE AND TIME” with the relevant conference buddies meetings for your event
