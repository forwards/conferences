<h1> Information on useR! Diversity Scholarships </h1>

Organization knowledge from past years put together by Jill Waring, Noa Tamir and Imke
Mayer


<h2> General process </h2>

* December: Applications open

* Feburary: Applications close

* February/March: Reviewing phase (ca. 2 weeks)

* March: Announcement of decisions

<h3> 1. Before application phase starts </h3>

<h4> Contact conference organizers </h4>

* to clarify organization questions (how many free tickets, how much funding, visa
fees covered?)

* to coordinate for logistics during the conference:	    
	* We need rooms for the diversity scholars meet and greets. Preferably one on the workshop day, and one on day 1 of the main conference. 
	* They should provide you with the diversity scholars emails, or email them on your behalf, so you can introduce the buddies initiative, invite them to the meet and greet and newbie session, and ask them permission to share their names with other scholars and with the buddies. 

<h4> Application form and portal </h4>

No consistent form/portal used in the past years. Solutions from the past years: <i>LimeSurvey</i>, university internal portal.

Make all fields mandatory to ensure all relevant information is provided. Limit the length for text fields and explicitly state that additional documents (CV, external document with longer answers, etc.) won't be taken into consideration for reviewing. This ensures equal treatment of all applications. 

Make sure the server use and location comply with with data protection regulation.

[Example of forms used previously](https://github.com/forwards/conferences/blob/master/DS_form.MD)

<h4> Create coordinating/contact team </h4>

Appoint 2-3 people from the diversity team (and/or conference organizers) to handle logistics during and after application phase. Tasks include:

- communicating with conference organizers,
- answering questions from applications or reviewers,
- make final decisions based on reviewers grade, diversity balance among scholars, available funds.

<h4> Create reviewing committee </h4>

Around 10 people from the Forwards organization. Usually there are around
150-200 applications, so 30-40 per reviewer.

Examples of reviewers from past years: Anna Quaglieri, Augustina Ragwitz, Imke
Mayer, Jennifer Thompson, Jonathan Godfrey, Julie Josse, Maëlle Salmon, Scott
Chamberlain, Sina Rüeger

<h3> 2. During application phase </h3>

Create an email alias specifically for DS related questions. Inform the conference organizers to forward questions related to DS to this alias.

<h3> 3. Reviewing and decision </h3>

Every application will be evaluated by 2 committee members, using a 1-4 scale.

<h4> Evaluation criteria </h4>

* The reasons for scholarship request are compelling, based on description of their R background and potential impact on their community.

* Are they from a country, region or area not typically represented at useR
(Jill Waring and Noa Tamir have stats from 2016, 2017, 2019 attendance by
	nation), or from an under-represented and/or historically marginalized group?

* Applicant information provided through the form is verified by examining
their public profile on twitter, github, R package authorship, R mailing lists,
via links provided by applicant.

* Note: The requested amount of funding will vary and is not taken into account
for the evaluation.

* Ideally give preference to individuals who have not been awarded DS in
 previous several years, but not a firm exclusion criteria, e.g., per Laura’s
 suggestion, some individuals may make continued and substantial contributions
 to R community, which would be worthwhile to recognize and support.

<h4> Summary scores </h4>

Interpretation of summary scores:

1 - _nothing outstanding_

2 - _some potential, but not enough given the quality/content of other
applications_

3 - _generally good, but still some drawback (e.g., not much opportunity to pay
forward, etc.)_

4 - _ticks all the boxes (recommendation: favor the most marginalised
groups/people - including disabilities - with least opportunity and/or those
that contribute a lot of volunteer time to the R community)_

The final selection will be based on the average score (between the two
	reviewers), with additional consideration of aims to include people from as
  many different groups as possible.

<h3> 4. At useR! conference </h3>

* Announce the DS welcome event as early as possible so that scholars can take
their plane/train tickets to be able to attend it.

* Example for the email to the scholars (including the newbie session details):
> 	Dear Diversity Scholars,
> 
> We are looking forward to meeting you at useR! YEAR. We wanted to make sure you noticed the following events in the schedule on DATE:
> 
> <Link to schedule>
> 
> The first is an opportunity just for diversity scholars to meet members of Forwards and a few other people who have volunteered to be conference buddies - people you can come to during the conference to ask questions or just chat with during the breaks, in case you don’t know anyone already!
> 
> The second is open to anyone who is new to useR! and will have a program of short, informal talks on a variety of topics that we think will be helpful for newcomers to the R community. Hopefully this will be a gentle introduction to the conference, a chance to meet more people - perhaps people going to the same tutorials as you the next day!
> 
> If you can’t come to these events, don’t worry. The team of conference buddies will be on the lookout for you to help you feel welcome at the conference. The conference buddies are:
> LIST OF BUDDIES 
> 
> We don’t advertise the names of diversity scholars to all attendees as you may not wish to publicize your scholarship. However recipients from last year said they wish they had known who the other scholars were, so we would like to share your name with other diversity scholars as well as the team of conference buddies. Please answer this quick poll: <LINK TO FORM FOR SCHOLARS> to let us know if you are happy for us to share you name with either/both groups. If you wish to remain anonymous you should not attend the meet and greet! Of course your name is known to a few people on the evaluation committee and on the local organisation committee, but we will respect your wishes regarding confidentiality.
> 
> Best wishes,
> Name, on behalf of Forwards
	
* There is a Google Form template you can copy for the scholars to agree to share their names [useR! Conference Buddies - Scholars Form](https://forms.gle/b8oX6RrX1ThHhiRh7). Please update the following:
	* 	Update logo image for current useR! combined with the Forwards logo
	* Update the year / hub in the form name
	* In the first question in section 2, replace “DATE AND TIME” with the relevant conference buddies meetings for your event


<h4> Agenda for DS welcome event </h4>

* Welcome

* Meet & Greet

* Outline the process for reimbursement of expenses


<h2> Tips for the DS team </h2>

<h3> Sub-coordination team </h3>

Create a small coordination team of 2-3 people taking care of answering
applicants questions and coordinating the evaluation process (allocate
applications to the diversity committee members, define evaluation standards
together with Forwards team, collect the committee members' evaluations, manage
the final selection process and communicate results to local organization
committee).

<h3> Information use and storage </h3>

* Follow the data storage guidelines to decide how and where to store the
application and review data. Note that the guidelines may depend on an
 reviewer's country of residency.  
	+ Data storage and usage guidelines for European citizen reviewers:
	 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679
	+ Reviewers within the EEA and New Zealand (countries covered by an adequacy
		 decision by GDPR) can download the raw data from the application platform
		 and store the data securely on a local drive (not cloud storage)

* Communicate the guidelines to the reviewing committee to ensure adequate data
storage and usage. Emphasize that it may contain sensitive information and must
not be shared with anyone.

* Keep the information on requested funding until shortly after the conference in case it needs to be accessed for reimbursement purposes.

* At the end of the conference, send a reminder to all committee members to
delete all the applicant information.


<h3> Reviewing forms </h3>

Provide an evaluation form
- 1 field for summary score (only whole numbers)
- 1 field for notes on why the reviewer has scored the application at this level.
What stands out as relevant applicant features or circumstances you considered
in your evaluation of application?

The comment will help for making the final decisions in case of a tie.

<h3> Clarify reimbursement methods with the office taking care of reimbursement
process </h3>

The method(s) of reimbursement should be practical for international recipients.
Bank wire (+ fees?), paypal, xoom, transferwise, etc.

Appoint a contact person for reimbursement related questions (or ask the conference organization to provide the name and contact of the person handling reimbursement).

<h3> Acceptance letters </h3>

For advice on specific wording for acceptance letters, to be most effective for
Visa applications see suggestions from Heather below. Consider also consulting
the International Students office of the co-hosting university.

<h4> Notes about acceptance letters content, via Heather Turner: </h4>

It may help to personalize them if possible. E.g., "the committee were impressed
by your work on ...", to show they are invited due to specific skills/expertise.
Visa offices are very concerned about the person returning, so also emphasising
community involvement, e.g., "It is good that you will be able to share the
knowledge learned with the R User Group in X when you return".

Some specific advice from Canadian government, which is probably good advice for
US visa applicants also:

> We stress how vital it is that applicants [...] provide as much information in
> their application as possible, especially regarding ties to their home country
> and the means and plans to return as that is the most common reason that
> applications are refused.
(<i> From https://twitter.com/PhABCD/status/1194711596423163905?s=20</i>)



Confirm that the scholarship covers
return travel and accommodation while they are in the US. I like the idea of
naming institutions that support the conference, not just naming the conference
which they won’t of heard of (and doesn’t have a very meaningful name outside
the community). According to Kevin O’Brien, who is looking into this issue for
Forwards, an invitation signed by a Government agency can improve the chances of
a Visa Application being accepted, so if the conference has such an association,
or a person working for such an agency (e.g. National Statistics agency) that
can sign it with their job title and affiliation as well as organizing committee
association, that could help.

<h2> Tips for applicants </h2>

* Check whether the funder has a policy on awarding scholarships to people that
attended under a scholarship previously, or who have had another scholarship
in the past year.
	+ If there is a clear exclusion and this applies to you, please sit this one
	out, and allow someone else to have an opportunity for assistance.
	+ Otherwise, disclose any scholarships as requested, but don't let previous
	success hold you back from applying.

* Be as specific as possible - don't make the reviewers guess or infer things.
	+ For example, someone might put that their organization is XYZ Computing. But
	 then they might not say what their job title is.  
	+ Are they an intern? Are they a full-time employee?

* Break down costs as much as possible.  
	+ When looking for airfare, look for the cost for coach.  
	+ Don't leave any costs out. Let the committee decide if the cost is
	reasonable and can be covered by the scholarship. Costs won't be taken into
	account during the reviewing/decision phase.

* Give evidence of your commitment to the field/community. Demonstrate that this
is a real interest and that you are in it for the long term, for example, for
an R conference you might mention
	+ R courses you have taken.
	+ How you use R in your work.
	+ Articles/blog posts where you have used R.
	+ Contributions you have made to publicly available packages.
	+ Involvement in R-ladies, an R User Group or other R-related initiative.

* Explain how you will pay it forwards. How will you share what you have
learned? Let the committee know how their investment in you will have a wider
impact. For example, for an R conference you might
	+ Commit to writing a blog post. Evidence of previously blogging about R would
	 be an advantage.
	+ Commit to live tweeting to share conference highlights with the R community.
	 Evidence of doing this for previous conferences, or using your Twitter
	 account to share insights about R would be an advantage.
	+ Commit to presenting a talk or workshop at your workplace/R user group.
	 Prior experience of giving such presentations would be an advantage.
	+ Discuss how you hope to integrate new R developments into your courses.
	+ Describe your existing mentoring roles and discuss how up-to-date knowledge
	 of R would be beneficial in these roles.
	+ Discuss how a specific conference tutorial will facilitate work in progress
	 that will be shared with the community.

* Make your application stand out by adding in some flavour about your personal
 journey in R. Without making your application too lengthy, paint the reader a
 picture of who you are, and why you deserve funding.
	+ How did you get to this point?  
	+ What is your motivation for applying?

<h2> FAQ </h2>

A small list of questions from applicants during application phase.

* Q: Is it possible to obtain more specifications about who is eligible for this
 diversity scholarship?
	+ A: No. We cannot provide a precise qualification of which kind of persons
	 could be targeted by the diversity scholarship since this could pose a threat
	 for the scholars' personal life. But if you think you might be eligible based
	 on the provided scholarship description, send us your application. Otherwise,
	 please refrain from applying.

* Q: The provided space for answers in the application form is too small. Can I
 send in a separate document with more detailed answers?
	+ A: No, please use the available space and try to be as concise as possible.
	 To ensure equal chances in the evaluation process, we cannot review more
	 detailed applications from some applicants while considering only the shorter
	 answers of all other applicants.

* Q: What are my chances of getting the diversity scholarship?
	+ A: In the past we received many applications and many of them met the
	 requirements but due to limited funding, we couldn't fund every eligible
	 candidate. If you consider that you are eligible for our diversity
	 scholarship, please fill in the application form. But you should also
	 consider alternative funding possibilities to increase your chances of
	 attending useR! with a funding.
