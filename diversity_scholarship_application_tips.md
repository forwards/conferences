# Tips for Diversity Scholarship Applicants

 - Check whether the funder has a policy on awarding scholarships to people that attended under a scholarship previously, or who have had another scholarship in the past year. 
 
     - If there is a clear exclusion and this applies to you, please sit this one out, and allow someone else to have an opportunity for assistance.
     - Otherwise, disclose any scholarships as requested, but don't let previous success hold you back from applying.

 - Be as specific as possible - don't make the reviewers guess or infer things. For example:
 
      - Don't just put that your organization is XYZ Computing, give your job title too. 
      - Are you an intern? A full-time employee?

 - Break down costs as much as possible. 
 
     - When looking for airfare, look for the cost for coach. 
     - Don't leave any costs out. Let the committee decide if the cost is reasonable and can be covered by the scholarship.
     
 - Evidence your technical competence. Provide links to an online portfolio of work. For an R conference, reviewers will be looking to establish a base level of R competence and evidence that you are developing your R skills. Your portfolio might include:
 
      - Coursework showing individual work.
      - Analysis scripts.
      - Articles/blog posts that show your code.
      - Presentations or tutorials with code that you have written.
      - A Shiny app. 
      - Contributions you have made to publicly available packages.
 
 - Evidence of your commitment to the field/community. Demonstrate that this is a real interest and that you are in it for the long term, for example, for an R conference you might mention
 
      - R courses you have taken.
      - How you use R in your work.
      - Articles/blog posts where you have used R.
      - Involvement in R-ladies, an R User Group or other R-related initiative.
 
 - Explain how you will pay it forwards. How will you share what you have learned? Let the committee know how their investment in you will have a wider impact. For example, for an R conference you might
 
     - Commit to writing a blog post. Evidence of previously blogging about R would be an advantage.
     - Commit to live tweeting to share conference highlights with the R community. Evidence of doing this for previous conferences, or using your Twitter account to share insights about R would be an advantage.
     - Commit to presenting a talk or workshop at your workplace/R user group. Prior experience of giving such presentations would be an advantage.
     - Discuss how you hope to integrate new R developments into your courses.
     - Describe your existing mentoring roles and discuss how up-to-date knowledge of R would be beneficial in these roles.
     - Discuss how a specific conference tutorial will facilitate work in progress that will be shared with the community.
     
- Make your application stand out by adding in some flavour about your personal journey in R. Without making your application too lengthy, paint the reader a picture of who you are, and why you deserve funding.      
    
    - How did you get to this point? 
    - What is your motivation for applying?
