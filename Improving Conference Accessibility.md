The following suggestions will be a list of best practices gleaned from other conferences or events in the community.  

## National Federation for the Blind Conference - 7/25/17    

Had a series of discussions with Jonathan Godfrey after attending the National Federation for the Blind Conference, in Orlando, Florida (7/10 â€“ 7/15.) The following represent the best suggestions for providing a better experience for blind attendees:  

**A formal facility tour:** The rationale was that once an attendee with vision problems has a basic overview of the venue layout, they should be able to navigate with confidence. So making sure that anyone who is interested knows when to attend the tour, at the beginning of the event, would probably be very helpful.  

**Organized walks to the Venue from Satellite Hotels:** The suggestion is that an established time be set from each of the satellite hotels to the main venue in the mornings, and the reverse in the evenings. Navigating in a new city can be difficult. And if an attendee is not outgoing, they might have difficulty finding someone to walk with. This way, there will be an established time and place to meet, and an established guide. The walking buddy will meet the interested attendees on the first day, so they know who will be included in their group.  

**Braille Placards for Food and Exhibit Tables:** Figuring out which food to eat was established as a problem. Having servers helps, but the placards would make blind attendees less reliant on help from the servers or other attendees. Also, the exhibit tables at the NFB conference all had small braille identifiers at the corner of each table. (Always the same corner, so it was easy to find.)  This would probably be a helpful addition to exhibit tables/booths at our conferences.
